		<content>Version 3.0
Mechadroids are now ready to be used in 1.4, this comes with a change of dependency from Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 to Asmiov, they now use the universal energy system in that so this no longer includes a redundant set of 'power cells'. Some changes:

- Mechadroids textures have been updated slightly.
- Mechadroids of each kind now have multiple body types.
- Crafting recipes for Mechadroids are now simpler, 'mechadroid parts' are no longer a thing.
- Repairing damaged Mechadroids is now done simply using steel.
- Crafted Mechadroids are now white, and will gradually get their more aged colour that most vanilla mechanoids have over time.
- Player Mechadroids can now be repainted, at any time using a gizmo, and won't visibly 'age' like they normally do if they are.

And if you have Biotech you'll see these differences:

- Mechadroid Gammas now function as Mechanitors naturally.
- Mechadroids are instead crafted at the Large Mechanoid Gestator.
